Very Good Software started after years of working in the tech industry dealing and fixing the messiest code bases.
From plain text passwords, all the way through spaghetti code, I spent most of my career bringing companies back to
profitable solutions. Now, I can do that for you too.

Does your data pipeline take two days to process ten megabytes of data? Is your new customer asking for a third-party
security review that you are dreading to take? Do you have to add a new feature to your product and all the quotes you
are getting are insane because the code is unmaintainable?

No worries. I got you. Let's fix it.
